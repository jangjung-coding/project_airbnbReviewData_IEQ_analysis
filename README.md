# Analysis of Airbnb Reviews for Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) Evaluation in the United States

**Purpose:** Enhance Post-Occupancy Evaluation (POE) of IEQ using text-mining of Airbnb reviews to capture immediate, unbiased feedback.

## üìå Background
Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) is crucial for the well-being of building occupants. However, traditional Post-Occupancy Evaluation (POE) methods have several limitations:

- **Delayed Data:** Long surveys and scheduled inspections cause delays in identifying issues.
- **Response Bias:** Feedback can be skewed due to incomplete disclosure or social desirability.
- **High Costs:** Comprehensive evaluations are costly, leading to infrequent assessments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Approach
This study analyzes 11.88 million Airbnb reviews from 34 U.S. cities using text-mining and word embeddings. This approach captures a broad spectrum of IEQ-related feedback, even when not explicitly stated, providing real-time, occupant-driven insights.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
Text-mining Airbnb reviews complements traditional POE by addressing its limitations, offering a more dynamic, unbiased, and cost-effective way to evaluate residential IEQ.
